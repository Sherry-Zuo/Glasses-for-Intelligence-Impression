# Glasses-for-Intelligence-Impression
Business Experimentation and Causal Effect

In this experiment, we study the effect of whether wearing glasses affects people’s perception of intelligence. We use wearing glasses as the treatment and “GPA” with different grade levels as the outcome variables in our experiment. The result of the experiment shows that just by wearing a pair of glasses, you can make yourself look smarter in others perception.
